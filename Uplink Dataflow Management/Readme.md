We consider a single-cell scenario with 250 m radius. The network model comprises a 5G NR cell and multiple Wi-Fi Basic Service Areas (BSAs). The cell consists of a gNB-NR entity located at the center. We assume that a PoP is present near the vicinity of gNB-NR. The 5G-Flow controller and the MRN OpenFlow switch can either be co-located with the gNB-NR entity or can be cloud-based. Multiple Wi-Fi APs provide radio coverage (BSA) inside the gNB-NR cell and are distributed uniformly. A UE in the network is assumed to have two radio interfaces: 5G-NR and Wi-Fi. We also assume that 80% users are connected to both the RATs while the remaining users are connected to only gNB-NR. The users, in our simulation model, are assumed to be stationary.
