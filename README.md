# 5G-Flow-RAN

We present a 5G multi-RAT system level simulator, developed in MATLAB. This simulator is designed for investigating the performance of dataflow management across multiple RATs.

The simulator has been developed at IIT Bombay and is shared under MIT license.

The simulator supports multiple RATs, i.e., gNB-NR and Wi-Fi, and we describe the implementation of physical and MAC layers of these RATs. We also discuss the implementation of the application and transport layer, which both the RATs share. Moreover, a centralized controller has been implemented that manages these RATs. The simulator supports downlink as well as the uplink communication channel.
